About the College
Thiagarajar College of Engineering (TCE) is as a Government Aided Autonomous Institution, established in 1957 by the philanthropist Late Karumuttu Thiagarajan Chettiar. TCE is affiliated to Anna University, Chennai, and approved by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). TCE offers a wide array of Undergraduate, Postgraduate and Ph.D. Programs across various disciplines of Engineering, Architecture and Science. The campus is set within a serene and eco-friendly environment surrounded by dense vegetation and best infrastructure facilities.

Each academic Department at TCE is dedicated to a specific theme, fostering synergy between faculty and students in academic and research endeavours. These themes encompass diverse areas such as Eco-friendly Structures, Power and Energy, Automation, Automotive, Wireless Technologies, Distributed Computing, Database Management, Modelling and Simulation, Material Science, Green Chemistry, and Heritage.

TCE has consistently embraced reforms and upgrades in its Teaching-Learning processes. Noteworthy initiatives include the implementation of a Competency-Based Curriculum and Outcome-Based Education. Since 2018, TCE has adopted the Conceive Design Implement Operate (CDIO) framework, shaping curriculum design, pedagogical methods, and assessment techniques, with adequate hands-on training to students.
